                    A small shop which sells expensive or designer clothing may be called a boutique.<br><br>
                    We slipped into our new clothes in the dressing room of a quiet little dress shop. <br><br>
<ul>
<li> It is a necessity of man. You can judge oneâ€™s character, taste and habits by the dress he wears.
<li>The fashion in dress has changed many times. In the olden days in India man used to wear dhoti, kurta or shirt and women sarees or lehnga. 
<li>The colours and cuts have also changed pattern. Sometime it is light colour and sometime it is dark. 
<li>You can find young boys wearing gaudy clothes. They will thrust a handkerchief in the upper pocket of their coat and a flower in the button hole.
<li>A man who is neatly dressed and is wearing polished shoes gives the impression of his clean habit. So the dress gives some idea about the habit of the wearer.
